            <p class="para1">The Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) was established in 1920 under the Indian Red Cross Society Act and incorporated under the Parliament Act XV of 1920 (as amended by Act No. 22 of 1956 and the adoption of laws (No 4) order of 1957 and the Act No. 14 of 1992). It is a member of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and is recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross. At present the organization is having a network of over 700 branches throughout the country, providing relief in times of disasters/emergencies and promotes health & care of the vulnerable people and communities. It is a leading member of the largest independent humanitarian organization in the world, the International Red Cross & Red Crescent Movement. The Mission of the Indian Red Cross is to inspire, encourage and initiate at all times all forms of humanitarian activities so that human suffering can be minimized and even prevented and 
                thus contribute to creating more congenial climate for peace.Red Cross was established in 1863 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Father of Red Cross movement and recipient of noble award for peace in 1901 was ‚ÄúJean Henry 
                Dunant‚Äù, who was a successful businessman.

            </div>
            
            <p>While going on a business mission, Dunant came on 24th June 1859 to Castiglione. It was on the same day, the battle of Solferino was fought nearby between 
                French and Austrian armies. Dunant was horrified and moved by the sight and plight of the wounded soldiers. On witnessing the pathetic scene he forgot his business and started relief operations to all the wounded soldiers without any discrimination taking the help from people in villages nearby. In 1862 Dunant wrote a book 
                ‚ÄúA memory of Solferino‚Äù which paved the way for the first Geneva Conference in 26th October 1863.The Geneva Society for Public Welfare, consider the Dunant‚Äôs proposals which was mentioned in the book and convene a multinational conference for implementing them.</p>
                <br>
            <p>A resolution for the formation of medical relief societies ‚ÄúSociety for the relief of wounded combatants‚Äù was passed and the Red Cross Emblem to protect the members of Relief team was adopted. The name was changed subsequently in the year 1867 as ‚ÄúRed Cross Society‚Äù by Netherland. In 1875 the five member commission of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare began to call itself the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC). In 1876 Muslim countries adopted Red Crescent on white background instead of Red Cross. 
                The Red Cross Societies in times of peace pursue a variety of activities devoted to the health, safety and well being of the people, with the best relationship, understanding and cooperation between many governments and their national societies.</p>

                <br>
            <p>The involvement and contribution of young people to the work of the Red Cross has an interesting history. This genesis of their engagement originated in the province of Quebec, Canada in 1914, when school children first participated in the humanitarian work of the Red Cross work by making bandages, dressings and other comforts for soldiers. The idea soon spread to Europe, United States Australia, Italy, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Yugoslavia France, Japan,
                 Romania and Sweden in short duration .</p>
            <p>In 1922, the youth programme of the Red Cross was officially recognized and supported by Resolution No. XVIII adopted by the General Council of League of Red Cross Societies and the expansion of Red Cross youth programmes to young people outside the schools or other than those attending
                 educational institution were embodied in one of the General Councils resolutions XIX.</p>

            <p class="principles-1">The XXth international Conference of the Red Cross at Vienna proclaimed the following seven 
                principles as the Fundamental Principles of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society in 1965.</p>
            <div class="principles-2">
                <p><span>Humanity:</span> The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavors, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being.
                    It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples</p><br>
                <p><span>Impartiality:</span> It makes no discrimination as to nationally, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavors to relieve the suffering of individuals,
                    being solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress</p><br>
                <p><span>Neutrality:</span> In orders to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage in controversies
                    of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature</p><br>
                <p><span>Independence:</span> The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that
                    they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement</p><br>
                <p><span>Voluntary service:</span> It is voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain</p></br>
                <p><span>Unity: </span>There can be only one Red Cross or Red Crescent in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory</p><br>
                <p><span> Universality:</span> The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide</p><br>
